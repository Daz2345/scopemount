### Usage

Download and extract themes to your Telescope package directory and add to your Telescope app by running the `meteor add` command e.g. `meteor add telescope-theme-sm-gemini`. All the themes use the default base and hubble themes as a dependency, so make sure you have them added to your app.

*Update: Scopemount themes are up-to-date with Telescope v0.20.4.*
