### Usage

Install automagically from Atmosphere

```bash
meteor add montecruiseto:telescope-theme-sm-<name>
```

so for instance if you wanted to add the 'Galileo' theme you would run

```bash
meteor add montecruiseto:telescope-theme-sm-galileo
```

Alternatively if you want to customize the themes: Download and extract the themes of your choice to your Telescope package directory and add to your Telescope app by running the `meteor add` command e.g. `meteor add montecruiseto:telescope-theme-sm-galileo`.
All the themes use the base and hubble theme as a dependency.
